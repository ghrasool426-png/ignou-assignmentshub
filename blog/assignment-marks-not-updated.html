  <!-- INTRO -->
  <p>
    Many IGNOU students become worried when their <strong>assignment marks are not updated</strong>
    on the official website. This issue is very common and usually gets resolved with time.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your assignment marks are missing, showing <strong>"Not Found"</strong> or
    <strong>"Under Process"</strong>, there is <strong>no need to panic</strong>.
    This guide explains exactly what you should do step by step.
  </p>

  <!-- STEP 0 -->
  <h2>First Step: Check Assignment Status on Official Website</h2>

  <p>
    Before taking any action, always check your assignment status on the
    official IGNOU assignment portal.
  </p>

  <p>If the status shows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Received</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Under Process</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    👉 This means your assignment has been successfully submitted and is currently
    under evaluation. In most cases, marks are updated automatically after evaluation.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your status is <strong>Received</strong> or <strong>Under Process</strong>,
    the best option is to <strong>wait patiently</strong>.
  </p>

  <!-- STEP 1 -->
  <h2>Step 1: Contact Your Study Centre</h2>

  <p>
    If a long time has passed and marks are still not updated,
    your first contact point should be your <strong>Study Centre</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>What you should do:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visit or contact your Study Centre</li>
    <li>Carry your <strong>assignment submission receipt</strong></li>
    <li>Confirm whether your assignment has been evaluated</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    📌 The receipt you received at the time of assignment submission is
    <strong>very important</strong>. Always keep it safe.
  </p>

  <!-- STEP 2 -->
  <h2>Step 2: Contact Your Regional Centre</h2>

  <p>
    If the Study Centre does not give a clear response,
    the next step is to contact your <strong>Regional Centre</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>You should provide:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Assignment submission receipt</li>
    <li>Enrollment number</li>
    <li>Programme code</li>
    <li>Course code</li>
    <li>Study Centre details</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You can contact the Regional Centre by visiting in person
    or by sending an email with scanned proof.
  </p>

  <p>
    In many cases, assignment marks are updated after verification
    at the Regional Centre level.
  </p>

  <!-- STEP 3 -->
  <h2>Step 3: File an RTI (Last Option)</h2>

  <p>
    If you do not receive any response even after contacting both
    the Study Centre and Regional Centre, you may file an
    <strong>RTI (Right to Information)</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>RTI should include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Copy of assignment submission receipt</li>
    <li>Enrollment number</li>
    <li>Programme and course details</li>
    <li>Clear query regarding assignment evaluation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    ⚠️ RTI should be used <strong>only as a last option</strong>.
    Most assignment issues are resolved before this stage.
  </p>

  <!-- IMPORTANT NOTES -->
  <h2>Important Things to Remember</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Assignment marks are uploaded in batches</li>
    <li>Delays are common due to heavy workload</li>
    <li>Late evaluation can cause temporary delay</li>
    <li>Technical updates may slow down mark uploading</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- NO PANIC -->
  <h2>Do Not Panic – Your Marks Will Be Updated</h2>

  <p>
    Thousands of IGNOU students face this issue every year,
    and in most cases, marks are updated automatically.
  </p>

  <p>
    ✔️ If your status shows <strong>Received</strong> or <strong>Under Process</strong><br>
    ✔️ If you have your submission receipt
  </p>

  <p>
    👉 Your assignment marks are <strong>safe</strong> and will be updated.
