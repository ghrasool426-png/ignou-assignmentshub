<p>
Many IGNOU students get worried when their <strong>assignment marks are not updated</strong>
on the official website. This issue is very common and in most cases
<strong>marks are updated automatically with time</strong>.
</p>

<p>
If your assignment status shows <strong>“Received”</strong> or <strong>“Under Process”</strong>,
there is <strong>no need to panic</strong>. This guide explains exactly what you should do.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>First Step: Check Assignment Status on Official Website</h2>

<p>
Before taking any action, always check your assignment status on the official IGNOU portal.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Received</strong> – Assignment successfully submitted and under evaluation</li>
  <li><strong>Under Process</strong> – Marks will be updated after evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>
👉 If status is <strong>Received</strong> or <strong>Under Process</strong>, the best option is to wait patiently.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Step 1: Contact Your Study Centre</h2>

<p>
If a long time has passed and marks are still not updated, your first contact point
should be your <strong>Study Centre</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visit or contact your Study Centre</li>
  <li>Carry your assignment submission receipt</li>
  <li>Confirm whether evaluation is completed</li>
</ul>

<p>
⚠️ The receipt given at the time of assignment submission is very important.
Always keep it safe.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Step 2: Contact Your Regional Centre</h2>

<p>
If the Study Centre does not give a clear response, the next step is to contact
your <strong>Regional Centre</strong>.
</p>

<p>You should provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enrollment number</li>
  <li>Programme code & course code</li>
  <li>Study Centre details</li>
  <li>Copy of assignment submission receipt</li>
</ul>

<p>
In many cases, marks are updated after verification at the Regional Centre level.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Step 3: File an RTI (Last Option)</h2>

<p>
If you do not receive any response even after contacting both the Study Centre
and Regional Centre, you may file an <strong>RTI (Right to Information)</strong>.
</p>

<p>RTI should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copy of assignment submission receipt</li>
  <li>Enrollment number</li>
  <li>Programme and course details</li>
  <li>Clear query regarding assignment evaluation</li>
</ul>

<p>
⚠️ RTI should be used <strong>only as a last option</strong>.  
Most assignment issues are resolved before this stage.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Important Things to Remember</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Assignment marks are uploaded in batches</li>
  <li>Delays are common due to heavy workload</li>
  <li>Late evaluation can cause temporary delay</li>
  <li>Technical updates may slow down mark uploading</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Do Not Panic – Your Marks Will Be Updated</h2>

<p>
Thousands of IGNOU students face this issue every year,
and in most cases <strong>marks are updated automatically</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>✔ Status shows Received or Under Process</li>
  <li>✔ You have your submission receipt</li>
  <li>👉 Your marks are safe and will be updated</li>
</ul>
