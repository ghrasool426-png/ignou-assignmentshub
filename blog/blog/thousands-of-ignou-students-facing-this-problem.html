  <h2>What Is This IGNOU Assignment Problem?</h2>

  <p>
    After submitting assignments, students expect marks to appear on their
    <strong>IGNOU grade card</strong>. Instead, many students see:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Status showing <strong>Received</strong></li>
    <li>Status showing <strong>Under Process</strong></li>
    <li>Blank assignment marks</li>
    <li>Grade card not updated</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This situation creates panic, especially when exams or results are near.
  </p>

  <!-- ================= SECTION ================= -->
  <h2>Why Are IGNOU Assignment Marks Not Updated?</h2>

  <h3>1. Delay at IGNOU Study Centre Level</h3>
  <p>
    IGNOU assignments are evaluated manually at study centres.
    Due to staff shortage and heavy workload, evaluation often gets delayed.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Regional Centre Data Upload Delay</h3>
  <p>
    Even after evaluation, marks must be uploaded to the central IGNOU system.
    This process sometimes takes weeks.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Wrong or Incomplete Student Details</h3>
  <p>
    Small mistakes like incorrect enrollment number, course code or session year
    can prevent marks from reflecting.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Heavy Server Load During Result Season</h3>
  <p>
    During term-end result periods, IGNOU servers face heavy traffic,
    causing temporary delays.
  </p>

  <h2>If Your Assignment Status Shows “Received” or “Under Process”</h2>

  <blockquote>
    ✅ Your assignment is safe  
    ✅ It is under evaluation  
    ❌ No need to panic immediately
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    IGNOU updates marks in phases, not all at once.
  </p>

  <h2>Step-by-Step Solution to Get IGNOU Assignment Marks Updated</h2>

  <h3>Step 1: Check Assignment Status Carefully</h3>
  <p>
    Always check status from the official IGNOU website.
    Make sure your details are correct.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 2: Wait for Normal Evaluation Time</h3>
  <p>
    Normally, marks are updated within <strong>30–60 days</strong> after submission.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3: Contact Your Study Centre</h3>
  <p>
    Visit your study centre with your assignment submission receipt.
    This receipt is very important.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 4: Contact Regional Centre</h3>
  <p>
    If study centre does not respond, email your regional centre
    with enrollment number, course code and receipt copy.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 5: Written Complaint</h3>
  <p>
    Submit a written application at the regional centre if required.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 6: RTI (Last Option)</h3>
  <p>
    RTI should be filed only if all other options fail.
  </p>
