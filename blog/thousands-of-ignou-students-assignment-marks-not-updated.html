  <h2>🔴 What Is the Problem Exactly?</h2>
  <p>
    After submitting assignments, students check their
    <strong>IGNOU assignment status</strong>.
    Instead of marks, they usually see:

  <ul>
    <li>Received</li>
    <li>Under Process</li>
    <li>Assignment marks blank</li>
    <li>Grade card not updated</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🤔 Why IGNOU Assignment Marks Are Not Updated?</h2>
