  <h1>Thousands of IGNOU Students Face This Problem Every Year – Assignment Marks Not Updated</h1>

  <p>
    Every year, thousands of students enrolled in the
    <strong>Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU)</strong>
    face a common and stressful issue —
    <strong>assignment marks not updated</strong> even after successful submission.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you submitted your assignments on time, received the submission receipt,
    but your marks are still not showing on the IGNOU website,
    then don’t panic — you are not alone.
  </p>

  <h2>What Is the Problem Exactly?</h2>
  <p>
    After submitting assignments, students usually check their status online.
    Instead of marks, they see:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Status showing <strong>“Received”</strong></li>
    <li>Status showing <strong>“Under Process”</strong></li>
    <li>Blank assignment marks</li>
    <li>Grade card not updated</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In many cases, this status remains unchanged for weeks or even months,
    which creates panic among IGNOU students.
  </p>

  <h2>Why IGNOU Assignment Marks Are Not Updated?</h2>

  <h3>1. Delay at Study Centre Level</h3>
  <p>
    Assignments are evaluated at study centres.
    Due to staff shortage, heavy workload and late checking,
    evaluation often gets delayed.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Delay in Regional Centre Upload</h3>
  <p>
    Even after evaluation, marks must be uploaded to the central IGNOU system.
    Technical issues and pending approvals can delay this process.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Incorrect Details</h3>
  <p>
    Any mistake in enrollment number, course code or session year
    can cause assignment marks to not reflect correctly.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Heavy Server Load</h3>
  <p>
    During result declaration periods, IGNOU servers experience heavy traffic,
    which can also delay updates.
  </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong><br>
      If your assignment status shows <strong>“Received”</strong> or
      <strong>“Under Process”</strong>, it means your assignment is safe
      and under evaluation. There is no need to panic immediately.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Step-by-Step: What You Should Do</h2>

  <h3>Step 1: Check Assignment Status Properly</h3>
  <p>
    Always check your assignment status from the official IGNOU website only.
    Ensure your enrollment number and programme details are correct.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 2: Wait for a Reasonable Time</h3>
  <p>
    IGNOU usually takes <strong>30–60 days</strong> after submission
    to update assignment marks. If submission was recent, wait patiently.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3: Contact Your Study Centre</h3>
  <p>
    If a long time has passed, visit your study centre with your
    <strong>assignment submission receipt</strong>.
    The receipt is very important — never lose it.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 4: Contact Regional Centre</h3>
  <p>
    If the study centre does not help, write an email to your
    Regional Centre with enrollment number, course code and receipt attached.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 5: File an RTI (Last Option)</h3>
  <p>
    If nothing works, students can file an RTI application.
    This option should be used only as a last resort.
  </p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  </p>

  </p>

  </p>
