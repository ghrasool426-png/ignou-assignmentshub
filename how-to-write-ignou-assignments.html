    Writing IGNOU assignments correctly is very important to score good marks.
    This guide explains the complete process of writing IGNOU assignments
    in a simple and clear manner.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Read the Question Carefully</h2>
  <p>
    Understand what the question is asking. Identify keywords such as
    discuss, explain, describe or analyse before writing the answer.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: Follow IGNOU Assignment Format</h2>
  <p>
    Use A4 size pages, write clearly with proper margins and include
    correct course code, enrolment number and study centre details
    on the front page.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: Write Answers in Your Own Words</h2>
  <p>
    IGNOU strictly discourages copied content. Answers should be written
    in your own words for better evaluation.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 4: Maintain Word Limit</h2>
  <p>
    Follow the word limit mentioned in the question paper.
    Writing too short or too long answers may affect marks.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 5: Proper Conclusion & References</h2>
  <p>
    End answers with a brief conclusion and mention references
    if required.
  </p>

  <h2>Important Note</h2>
  <p>
    All guidance provided on this website is strictly for
    <strong>educational and reference purposes only</strong>.
    Students must write assignments independently.
