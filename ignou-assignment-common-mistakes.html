    Many IGNOU students lose marks due to avoidable mistakes in assignments.
    Understanding these mistakes can help you score better.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Copy-Paste Content</h2>
  <p>
    Copying content from guides or the internet can lead to poor evaluation.
    Always write answers in your own words.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Ignoring Word Limit</h2>
  <p>
    Writing too short or too long answers can reduce marks.
    Follow the word limit mentioned in the question paper.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Poor Presentation</h2>
  <p>
    Untidy handwriting, missing margins and unclear answers
    affect the overall impression.
