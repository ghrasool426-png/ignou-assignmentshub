  <!-- ===== HOW TO USE ===== -->
  <h2>How to Use IGNOU Study Material Effectively?</h2>

  <p>
    Many students make the mistake of memorizing study material instead of
    understanding it. Follow these tips for better results:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Read each unit carefully before writing assignments</li>
    <li>Make short notes in your own words</li>
    <li>Use headings and subheadings in answers</li>
    <li>Relate answers directly to IGNOU book content</li>
    <li>Avoid copy-paste or direct reproduction</li>
  </ol>

  <!-- ===== STUDY MATERIAL VS ASSIGNMENTS ===== -->
  <h2>Relation Between Study Material & Assignments</h2>

  <p>
    IGNOU assignments are designed to test how well a student understands the
    official study material. Writing assignments without referring to IGNOU books
    often leads to low marks.
