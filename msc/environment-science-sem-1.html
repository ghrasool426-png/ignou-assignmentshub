  <h2>Q1. Explain the key principles of the ecosystem approach to conserving natural resources.</h2>

  <p>
    The ecosystem approach is a comprehensive strategy for conserving natural resources
    by managing land, water and living organisms in an integrated manner.
    It recognizes that humans are an integral part of ecosystems and emphasizes
    sustainable use rather than exploitation.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the key principles is <strong>holistic management</strong>.
    This principle focuses on maintaining ecosystem structure, functions and processes
    such as nutrient cycling, energy flow and species interactions.
    Healthy ecosystems provide essential services like climate regulation and soil fertility.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Sustainable use of resources</strong> is another core principle.
    Natural resources must be used at a rate that allows regeneration.
    Sustainable forestry, fisheries management and water conservation ensure
    long-term availability of resources.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Biodiversity conservation</strong> enhances ecosystem resilience and stability.
    Diverse ecosystems can better withstand environmental disturbances and climate change.
  </p>

  <p>
    The principle of <strong>adaptive management</strong> acknowledges that ecosystems are dynamic.
    Management strategies must be flexible and based on scientific monitoring and feedback.
  </p>

  <p>
    Community participation and equity are also emphasized.
    Local communities possess traditional knowledge and depend on ecosystems for livelihoods.
    Their involvement ensures effective and socially just conservation.
  </p>

  <p>
    In conclusion, the ecosystem approach promotes integrated, sustainable and participatory
    conservation of natural resources.

  <h2>Q2. Explain the human impact on ecosystem functioning, global energy flow, food security and public health.</h2>

  <p>
    Human activities such as deforestation, industrialization and urbanization
    have significantly altered ecosystem functioning.
    These activities disrupt nutrient cycles, reduce biodiversity and degrade ecosystem services.
  </p>

  <p>
    Global energy flow has been affected due to heavy dependence on fossil fuels.
    Increased greenhouse gas emissions have resulted in climate change,
    global warming and extreme weather events.
  </p>

  <p>
    Food security is threatened by land degradation, excessive use of fertilizers,
    pesticide pollution and climate variability.
    These factors reduce agricultural productivity and increase hunger risks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Public health is closely linked to ecosystem health.
    Air pollution causes respiratory diseases,
    while water pollution leads to water-borne illnesses.
    Climate change increases vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue.
  </p>

  <p>
    Loss of biodiversity also affects medicinal resources and disease regulation.
    Thus, unsustainable human activities threaten ecosystem stability and human well-being.
  </p>

  <!-- Q3 -->
  <h2>Q3. Discuss the causes of land degradation. Explain the strategies for ecosystem restoration.</h2>

  <p>
    Land degradation refers to the decline in land quality and productivity.
    Major causes include deforestation, overgrazing, soil erosion,
    unsustainable agriculture, mining and urban expansion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Excessive chemical use and improper irrigation lead to soil salinization
    and nutrient depletion.
    Climate change further accelerates desertification.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ecosystem restoration aims to restore ecological balance.
    <strong>Afforestation and reforestation</strong> improve soil stability
    and biodiversity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sustainable land management practices such as crop rotation,
    organic farming and watershed management help restore soil fertility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Community participation, use of native species and long-term monitoring
    are essential for successful restoration.
  </p>

  <!-- Q4 -->
  <h2>Q4. Write short notes on any two:</h2>

  <h3>(a) Sustainable Development</h3>
  <p>
    Sustainable development refers to development that meets present needs
    without compromising future generations.
    It integrates economic growth, environmental protection and social equity.
  </p>

  <h3>(d) Biodiversity</h3>
  <p>
    Biodiversity includes genetic, species and ecosystem diversity.
    It enhances ecosystem stability and provides essential services
    such as food, medicine and climate regulation.
  </p>

  <!-- Q5 -->
  <h2>Q5. Describe the processes that affect community organisation.</h2>

  <p>
    Community organisation refers to the structure and interaction of species
    within an ecological community.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Intraspecific interactions</strong> occur within the same species,
    such as competition among plants for sunlight.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Interspecific interactions</strong> occur between different species,
    including predation (lion and deer), mutualism (bee and flower)
    and parasitism (parasite and host).
  </p>

  <p>
    These interactions regulate population size and maintain ecological balance.
  </p>
