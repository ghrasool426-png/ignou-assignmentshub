<h2>MEV-011: Fundamentals of Environmental Science and Ecology</h2>

<h3>Q1. Key Principles of Ecosystem Approach</h3>
<p>
The ecosystem approach is a strategy for integrated management of land, water, and living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way. It recognizes humans as an integral part of ecosystems and emphasizes holistic management, adaptive strategies, ecosystem functioning, sustainable use, equitable benefit sharing, and inter-sectoral cooperation. By maintaining ecological integrity and involving local communities, the ecosystem approach ensures long-term environmental sustainability.
</p>

<h3>Q2. Human Impact on Ecosystems, Energy Flow, Food Security and Public Health</h3>
<p>
Human activities such as deforestation, industrialization, fossil fuel consumption, and intensive agriculture have disrupted ecosystem functioning and global energy flow. These impacts have reduced food security, increased climate risks, and caused public health issues like respiratory diseases, malnutrition, and spread of vector-borne diseases. Sustainable development and ecosystem restoration are essential to mitigate these effects.
</p>

<h3>Q3. Causes of Land Degradation and Ecosystem Restoration</h3>
<p>
Land degradation results from deforestation, overgrazing, unsustainable agriculture, mining, and climate change. Ecosystem restoration strategies include afforestation, soil conservation, sustainable farming, wetland restoration, and community participation to restore ecological balance.
</p>

<h3>Q4. Short Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainable Development:</strong> Development that balances economic growth, social equity, and environmental protection.</li>
<li><strong>Carbon Footprint:</strong> Total greenhouse gas emissions caused directly or indirectly by human activities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Q5. Community Organisation and Species Interactions</h3>
<p>
Community organisation is influenced by environmental factors, disturbances, succession, and species interactions. Interspecific interactions include competition, predation, mutualism, parasitism, and commensalism, while intraspecific interactions involve competition and cooperation within the same species.
</p>

<h3>Q6. Ecological Succession</h3>
<p>
Succession is the gradual change in species composition over time. It may be primary or secondary and proceeds through stages like nudation, invasion, competition, and climax formation.
</p>

<h3>Q7. Structure and Function of Ecosystem</h3>
<p>
An ecosystem consists of biotic and abiotic components. Its functions include energy flow, nutrient cycling, and provision of ecosystem services essential for life.
</p>

<h3>Q8. Nitrogen and Phosphorus Cycles</h3>
<p>
Nitrogen and phosphorus cycles regulate nutrient availability in ecosystems. Human activities have disrupted these cycles, leading to eutrophication and pollution.
</p>

<h2>MEV-012: Earth Processes</h2>

<h3>Formation of Continents and Oceans</h3>
<p>
The formation of continents and oceans is explained by continental drift and plate tectonics. Processes such as seafloor spreading, subduction, and plate collision continuously reshape the Earth’s surface.
</p>

<h3>Depositional Features of Rivers and Glaciers</h3>
<p>
Rivers form floodplains, deltas, levees, and alluvial fans, while glaciers form moraines, drumlins, eskers, and outwash plains through sediment deposition.
</p>

<h3>Volcanic Impacts</h3>
<p>
Volcanoes cause destruction but also enrich soils, form new landforms, and provide geothermal energy.
</p>

<h3>Atmosphere, Hydrology & Natural Hazards</h3>
<p>
The atmosphere regulates climate and supports life. Surface and groundwater movement is part of the hydrological cycle. Natural hazards include geological, meteorological, biological, and climatic hazards.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>MEV-013: Environmental Chemistry</h2>

<h3>Environmental Chemistry & Redox Reactions</h3>
<p>
Environmental chemistry studies chemical processes in air, water, soil, and organisms. Redox reactions involving electron transfer are fundamental to pollution control, corrosion, and energy flow.
</p>

<h3>Lubricants</h3>
<p>
Lubricants reduce friction and wear. They are classified as liquid, semi-solid, and solid lubricants and function through hydrodynamic, boundary, and extreme pressure lubrication.
</p>

<h3>Eco-friendly Pesticides</h3>
<p>
Eco-friendly pesticides are biodegradable and reduce environmental pollution while supporting sustainable agriculture.
</p>

<h3>Ozone Depletion</h3>
<p>
Ozone depletion caused by CFCs increases UV radiation, affecting human health, plants, and marine life.
</p>

<h3>Analytical Techniques</h3>
<p>
IR Spectrometry, Mass Spectrometry, HPLC, and radiochemical techniques are widely used in environmental monitoring and pollution analysis.
