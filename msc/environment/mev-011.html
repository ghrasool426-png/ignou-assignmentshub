<h2>Question 1: Explain the concept of environment and its major components.</h2>

<p>
The term <strong>environment</strong> refers to the sum total of all external conditions, influences and interactions that affect the life and development of organisms. It includes both biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components that surround an organism.
</p>

<p>
Environment plays a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth. It provides essential resources such as air, water, food and shelter. Human survival and development are deeply dependent on a healthy environment.
</p>

<h3>Major Components of Environment</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong>  
  The gaseous layer surrounding the Earth. It contains oxygen, nitrogen and other gases necessary for life and climate regulation.</li>

  <li><strong>Hydrosphere:</strong>  
  Includes all forms of water such as oceans, rivers, lakes, glaciers and groundwater. It supports aquatic life and regulates temperature.</li>

  <li><strong>Lithosphere:</strong>  
  The solid outer layer of Earth consisting of soil, rocks and minerals. It provides land for agriculture and human settlements.</li>

  <li><strong>Biosphere:</strong>  
  Comprises all living organisms including plants, animals and microorganisms interacting with other environmental components.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The balance among these components is essential for ecological stability and sustainable development.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Question 2: Discuss ecosystem structure and functions.</h2>

<p>
An <strong>ecosystem</strong> is a functional unit of nature where living organisms interact with the physical environment. It includes biotic and abiotic components functioning together through energy flow and nutrient cycling.
</p>

<h3>Structure of an Ecosystem</h3>

<p>
The structure of an ecosystem refers to the organization of its components:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Producers:</strong> Green plants that prepare food through photosynthesis.</li>
  <li><strong>Consumers:</strong> Herbivores, carnivores and omnivores that depend on producers.</li>
  <li><strong>Decomposers:</strong> Bacteria and fungi that break down organic matter.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Functions of an Ecosystem</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Energy flow through food chains and food webs</li>
  <li>Nutrient cycling (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus cycles)</li>
  <li>Regulation of population and climate</li>
  <li>Support of biodiversity</li>
</ul>

<p>
Efficient ecosystem functioning is necessary for environmental sustainability.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Question 3: Describe natural resources and their conservation.</h2>

<p>
<strong>Natural resources</strong> are materials and components found in nature that are used by humans for survival and development. These include renewable and non-renewable resources.
</p>

<h3>Types of Natural Resources</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Forest resources</li>
  <li>Water resources</li>
  <li>Mineral resources</li>
  <li>Energy resources</li>
  <li>Land resources</li>
</ul>

<h3>Need for Conservation</h3>

<p>
Rapid population growth, industrialization and over-exploitation have led to depletion of natural resources. Conservation ensures sustainable use for future generations.
</p>

<p>
Conservation methods include afforestation, water harvesting, renewable energy use and environmental laws.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Question 4: Explain environmental pollution and its types.</h2>

<p>
Environmental pollution refers to the introduction of harmful substances into the environment causing adverse effects on living organisms and ecosystems.
</p>

<h3>Major Types of Pollution</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Air pollution</li>
  <li>Water pollution</li>
  <li>Soil pollution</li>
  <li>Noise pollution</li>
  <li>Radioactive pollution</li>
</ul>

<p>
Control of pollution is essential for maintaining environmental quality and human health.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Question 5: Discuss the role of environmental education.</h2>

<p>
Environmental education aims to create awareness about environmental issues and promote responsible behavior toward nature.
</p>

<p>
It helps individuals understand ecological problems, develop sustainable practices and participate in environmental protection.
</p>

<p>
Environmental education plays a key role in achieving sustainable development goals.
