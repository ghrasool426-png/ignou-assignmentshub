<h2>Question 1: Explain the nature and scope of Geography.</h2>

<p>
Geography is a systematic study of the Earth’s surface, physical features,
human activities and the interaction between humans and the environment.
The word geography is derived from the Greek words <em>Geo</em> (Earth) and
<em>Graphien</em> (to describe).
</p>

<p>
Geography is both a natural science and a social science. It studies natural
phenomena such as landforms, climate, vegetation and water bodies, as well as
human aspects like population, settlements, agriculture and industries.
</p>

<h3>Scope of Geography</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Physical Geography – landforms, climate, soils, oceans</li>
  <li>Human Geography – population, economic activities, settlements</li>
  <li>Environmental Geography – human–environment interaction</li>
  <li>Regional Geography – study of specific regions</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus, geography has a wide scope and plays an important role in sustainable
development and environmental planning.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Question 2: Discuss the branches of Physical Geography.</h2>

<p>
Physical Geography deals with the study of natural features and processes of
the Earth. It focuses on physical elements that shape the planet.
</p>

<h3>Main Branches</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Geomorphology:</strong> Study of landforms and surface processes.</li>
  <li><strong>Climatology:</strong> Study of climate and weather patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>Oceanography:</strong> Study of oceans and seas.</li>
  <li><strong>Hydrology:</strong> Study of water on Earth.</li>
  <li><strong>Biogeography:</strong> Distribution of plants and animals.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Physical Geography helps in understanding natural hazards, climate change and
resource management.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Question 3: Explain Human Geography and its importance.</h2>

<p>
Human Geography studies human population, culture, settlements and economic
activities in relation to the environment. It examines how humans adapt to
and modify their surroundings.
</p>

<h3>Importance of Human Geography</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding population distribution</li>
  <li>Urban and rural planning</li>
  <li>Economic development analysis</li>
  <li>Regional planning</li>
</ul>

<p>
Human geography is essential for policy-making and sustainable development.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Question 4: Describe the concept of region in Geography.</h2>

<p>
A region is an area with common characteristics that distinguish it from
other areas. Regions may be physical, cultural or economic.
</p>

<h3>Types of Regions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Formal Region</li>
  <li>Functional Region</li>
  <li>Perceptual Region</li>
</ul>

<p>
Regional analysis helps geographers understand spatial patterns and variations.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Question 5: Discuss the relevance of Geography in modern society.</h2>

<p>
Geography plays a vital role in addressing modern issues such as climate
change, urbanization, disaster management and resource conservation.
</p>

<p>
It helps planners, environmentalists and policy-makers take informed decisions
for sustainable development.
