  <h1>IGNOU Extends Re-Registration Deadline for January 2026 Session Till 31 January</h1>
</header>

<main>

  <p>
    The Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) has officially announced the commencement of the re-registration process for the January 2026 academic session for all Open and Distance Learning (ODL) and Online programmes. According to the latest notification, the re-registration process began on <strong>1 December 2025</strong>, and the university has now extended the last date to <strong>31 January 2026</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This extension provides additional time to students who were unable to complete the process earlier due to academic, technical, or personal reasons.
  </p>

  <h2>Relief for Lakhs of IGNOU Students</h2>

  <p>
    The extended deadline comes as a major relief for lakhs of IGNOU learners in India and abroad. Re-registration is a mandatory requirement for existing students who wish to continue their studies in the next semester or academic year. Without successful re-registration, students will not be permitted to appear in examinations or access academic services for the January 2026 session.
  </p>

  <h2>Programmes Covered Under Re-Registration</h2>

  <p>
    The re-registration facility applies to <strong>all ODL and Online programmes</strong>, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Undergraduate programmes</li>
    <li>Postgraduate programmes</li>
    <li>Diploma courses</li>
    <li>Certificate programmes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Students must re-register for the upcoming year or semester by paying the prescribed programme fee through the official IGNOU Samarth portal.
  </p>

  <h2>Reason Behind Deadline Extension</h2>

  <p>
    According to IGNOU officials, the decision to extend the deadline was taken after receiving multiple requests from students and regional centres. Many learners reported issues related to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Online fee payment failures</li>
    <li>Samarth portal access problems</li>
    <li>Delay in declaration of previous semester results</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Complete IGNOU Re-Registration</h2>

  <div class="highlight">
    <p><strong>Steps to re-register:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Visit the official IGNOU Samarth portal</li>
      <li>Login using enrollment number and programme details</li>
      <li>Select courses for the January 2026 session</li>
      <li>Pay the required programme fee online</li>
      <li>Download and save the confirmation receipt</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>
    Students are advised to complete the process well before the deadline to avoid last-minute technical issues.
  </p>

  <h2>Important Clarification by IGNOU</h2>

  <p>
    IGNOU has clarified that <strong>re-registration is different from fresh admission</strong>. New applicants must apply through the admission portal, while existing students should use only the re-registration link.
  </p>

  <h2>Expert Advice for Students</h2>

  <p>
    Academic experts recommend that students regularly check official IGNOU notifications for updates related to re-registration, examinations, assignment submissions, and results. Failure to re-register within the extended deadline may lead to academic loss and delay in programme completion.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

  <p>
    By extending the re-registration deadline till <strong>31 January 2026</strong>, IGNOU has once again demonstrated its learner-centric approach. Students are encouraged to utilize the extended timeline and complete their re-registration at the earliest to ensure a smooth continuation of their academic journey.
