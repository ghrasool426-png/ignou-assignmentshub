  <!-- ================= SECTION A ================= -->
  <h2>Section A (Short Answers)</h2>
  <p><strong>Answer any four (100 words each)</strong></p>

  <h3>Q1 (iii) Bhavabhuti as a Dramatist</h3>
  <p>
    Bhavabhuti is one of the greatest Sanskrit dramatists, known for his intense
    emotional depth and philosophical seriousness. Unlike Kalidasa’s lyrical grace,
    Bhavabhuti focuses on human suffering, moral dilemmas and psychological realism.
    His major works include <em>Malatimadhava</em>, <em>Mahaviracharita</em> and
    <em>Uttararamacharita</em>. He excels in portraying <strong>Karuna Rasa</strong>
    and presents complex characters driven by inner conflict.
  </p>

  <h3>Q1 (vi) Sangam Literature</h3>
  <p>
    Sangam Literature refers to ancient Tamil literary works composed between
    300 BCE and 300 CE. It is divided into <strong>Akam</strong> (love/inner life)
    and <strong>Puram</strong> (war/public life) poetry. These texts provide valuable
    insight into early Tamil society, ethics, politics and cultural life.
  </p>

  <!-- ================= SECTION B ================= -->
  <h2>Section B (Medium Answers)</h2>
  <p><strong>Answer any two (250 words each)</strong></p>

  <h3>Q2 (i) Purpose of Dramatic Art according to Natyashastra</h3>
  <p>
    According to Bharatamuni’s <em>Natyashastra</em>, the primary purpose of dramatic
    art is to educate and entertain society. Drama serves as a mirror of life,
    presenting moral lessons through emotional engagement. The concept of
    <strong>Rasa</strong> lies at the core of Indian dramaturgy, allowing audiences
    to experience aesthetic pleasure while learning ethical values.
  </p>

  <!-- ================= SECTION C ================= -->
  <h2>Section C (Long Answers)</h2>
  <p><strong>Answer any three (350 words each)</strong></p>

  <!-- Q3 (i) -->
  <h3>Q3 (i) Kalidasa’s Reworking of Shakuntala</h3>
  <p>
    Kalidasa’s <em>Abhijnana Shakuntalam</em> is a refined artistic transformation
    of the Shakuntala episode from the <em>Mahabharata</em>. While the epic presents
    the story in a direct narrative form, Kalidasa enhances it with emotional depth,
    romantic sensitivity and dramatic structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    One major innovation is the introduction of Durvasa’s curse, which causes
    Dushyanta to forget Shakuntala. This change protects the king’s moral stature
    and shifts responsibility from deliberate neglect to fate. Kalidasa also
    softens Shakuntala’s character, portraying her as gentle, emotional and modest,
    thereby intensifying <strong>Shringara Rasa</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The ring motif symbolizes memory, destiny and recognition, adding dramatic
    suspense. Through separation and reunion, Kalidasa explores love, suffering
    and redemption, elevating the narrative into a timeless romantic masterpiece.
  </p>

  <!-- Q3 (ii) -->
  <h3>Q3 (ii) Draupadi’s Questions in the Kuru Court</h3>
  <p>
    During her humiliation in the Kuru court, Draupadi raises a profound moral
    question: whether Yudhishthira had the right to stake her after losing himself.
    This question exposes the ethical failure of the elders present in the court.
  </p>
  <p>
    Draupadi’s argument challenges patriarchal authority and highlights the dignity
    and autonomy of women. Her courage, logical reasoning and moral clarity make her
    a powerful voice of justice. Even in extreme humiliation, she refuses to accept
    injustice, revealing her strength, intelligence and resilience.
  </p>

  <!-- Q3 (vi) -->
  <h3>Q3 (vi) Dharma as the Central Theme of the Mahabharata</h3>
  <p>
    Dharma is the central philosophical foundation of the <em>Mahabharata</em>.
    Rather than presenting a rigid moral code, the epic portrays dharma as complex,
    situational and deeply human. Characters constantly face moral dilemmas where
    every choice carries consequences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yudhishthira’s struggles, Krishna’s pragmatic guidance and Bhishma’s lifelong
    vow all demonstrate different interpretations of dharma. The epic suggests that
    righteousness is not absolute but must be understood through wisdom, compassion
    and responsibility.
  </p>
