  <h2>Section – I</h2>

  <div class="question">Q1. What is Liberalism? Explain.</div>
  <p>
    Liberalism is one of the most influential political ideologies that emphasizes
    individual freedom, equality before law, reason, tolerance and limited government.
    The core belief of liberalism is that individuals are rational and capable of making
    decisions for their own welfare, and therefore their liberty should be protected
    from unnecessary state interference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Historically, liberalism emerged in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries as a
    reaction against absolute monarchy, feudal privileges and the domination of the
    church. Thinkers like John Locke, Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham and J.S. Mill laid its
    foundations. John Locke argued that individuals possess natural rights such as life,
    liberty and property, and the main purpose of the state is to protect these rights.
  </p>
  <p>
    Political liberalism supports constitutional government, rule of law, separation
    of powers and civil liberties. Economic liberalism advocates free markets and
    private property. In the 20th century, modern liberalism emphasized welfare,
    education and social security to ensure real freedom.
  </p>

  <div class="question">Q2. Write a note on Welfare State.</div>
  <p>
    A Welfare State is a form of state organization in which the government assumes
    responsibility for the social and economic well-being of its citizens. It aims to
    ensure minimum living standards, social security and equal opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
    The welfare state expanded in the 20th century after the Great Depression and World
    War II. It includes public healthcare, education, unemployment benefits, pensions
    and housing assistance. Though criticized for high expenditure, it remains vital
    for social justice.
  </p>

  <div class="question">Q3. What do you understand by Libertarianism?</div>
  <p>
    Libertarianism emphasizes maximum individual liberty and minimal state interference.
    It supports free markets and strong property rights. Thinkers like Robert Nozick
    argued that redistribution through taxation violates individual freedom.
  </p>

  <div class="question">Q4. Discuss Historical Materialism.</div>
  <p>
    Historical materialism, developed by Karl Marx, explains history through material
    conditions and class struggle. According to Marx, economic relations shape politics,
    law and ideology.
  </p>

  <div class="question">Q5. Examine Gramsci’s notion of Hegemony.</div>
  <p>
    Gramsci’s concept of hegemony explains how ruling classes maintain dominance through
    consent rather than force. Cultural institutions help legitimize power, while
    counter-hegemony challenges domination.
  </p>

  <div class="question">Q6. Explain the characteristics of Fundamentalism.</div>
  <p>
    Fundamentalism stresses strict adherence to religious doctrines, rejection of
    secularism and intolerance of pluralism. It often resists modern democratic values.
  </p>

  <div class="question">Q7. What is Nationalism?</div>
  <p>
    Nationalism emphasizes loyalty to the nation based on shared culture, history or
    territory. It has inspired liberation movements but also conflicts.
  </p>

  <div class="question">Q8. Elaborate upon Multiculturalism.</div>
  <p>
    Multiculturalism supports cultural diversity, minority rights and inclusive
    citizenship. It challenges assimilation and promotes coexistence.
  </p>

  <div class="question">Q9. Explain the Fascist World View.</div>
  <p>
    Fascism is an authoritarian ideology that rejects democracy and liberalism. It
    promotes nationalism, militarism and absolute state authority.
  </p>

  <div class="question">Q10. Discuss the Gender–Sex distinction in Feminism.</div>
  <p>
    Feminism distinguishes biological sex from socially constructed gender roles.
    Inequality arises from social norms, not biology, making this distinction central
    to feminist theory.
