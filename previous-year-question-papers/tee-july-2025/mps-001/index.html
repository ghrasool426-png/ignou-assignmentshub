  <h2>Section – I</h2>

  <div class="question">
    <h3>Q1. What is Liberalism? Explain.</h3>
    <p>Liberalism is a political ideology that emphasizes individual liberty, equality before law, reason, tolerance and limited government. It emerged in Europe during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as a reaction against absolute monarchy and feudal privileges. Thinkers like John Locke argued that individuals possess natural rights such as life, liberty and property, and the primary function of the state is to protect these rights.</p>
    <p>Political liberalism supports constitutional government, rule of law, separation of powers and civil liberties. Economic liberalism favours free markets and minimal state intervention. Over time, modern liberalism evolved to support welfare measures to ensure real freedom. Thus, liberalism is a dynamic ideology committed to human dignity and freedom.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <h3>Q2. Write a note on Welfare State.</h3>
    <p>A welfare state is a system in which the government takes responsibility for ensuring social and economic security for its citizens. It aims to provide minimum standards of living through education, healthcare, social security and employment support. The welfare state emerged in the twentieth century to reduce inequalities produced by capitalism.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <h3>Q3. What do you understand by Libertarianism?</h3>
    <p>Libertarianism emphasizes maximum individual freedom and minimal state intervention. It supports strong property rights, free markets and limited government functions such as defence and law enforcement. Thinkers like Robert Nozick argued that redistribution through taxation violates individual liberty.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <h3>Q4. Discuss Historical Materialism.</h3>
    <p>Historical materialism, developed by Karl Marx, explains history through material conditions and class struggle. According to Marx, economic relations shape politics, law and ideology. Changes in the mode of production lead to changes in society.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    <h3>Q5. Examine Gramsci’s notion of Hegemony.</h3>
    <p>Gramsci argued that ruling classes maintain dominance through consent rather than force. Cultural institutions such as education and media help create acceptance of ruling ideas. He emphasized the role of intellectuals and counter-hegemony in social change.</p>
  </div>

  </div>
